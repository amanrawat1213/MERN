    <p>Introduction to HTML Forms
        <br>
        HTML forms are essential for collecting user input on web pages. Whether it's a search bar, a login screen, or a
        multi-field registration form, HTML forms play a key role in web interactions. They enable users to submit data,
        which can be processed, stored, or returned by a server.
        <br>

        Why Do We Use Forms?
        <br>
        Forms serve as the gateway between the user and the server, allowing for dynamic, interactive web experiences.
        They are crucial for tasks such as user authentication, data submission, feedback collection, and more. Simply
        put, forms make websites more engaging and functional.
        <br>

        HTML Forms Structure:
        <br>
        The fundamental structure of an HTML form is encapsulated within the
    <form> tags. Inside these tags, you'll place various form controls like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and
        buttons for submitting the form.</p>
        <p>How to Use Form Controls?
            <br>
            The input tag is commonly used to create form controls. The attributes of this tag define the control's
            behavior.
            <br>
            The "type" attribute specifies the type of input control (e.g., text, password, checkbox).
            <br>

            The "name" attribute is used for identifying the control, especially when the data is sent to the server.
            <br>

            The "value" attribute sets a default value for the control, which the user can overwrite.
        </p>
        <form action="">
            <div>
                <label>Enter your user name</label>
                <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your username">
                <!--You can provide lable for a placeholder in order to make it more-->
            </div>
            <div>
                <label>Gender:</label>
                <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">
                <label for="male">Male</label>
                <input type="radio" id="female" name="gender"
                    value="female"><!--The name is written same so that only one choice could be selected at a time-->
                <label for="female">Female</label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <input type="checkbox" id="subscribe" name="subscribe" value="yes">
                <label for="subscribe">Subscribe to newsletter</label>
            </div>
            <p>Textarea & Select
                In addition to the basic input types, HTML forms offer other controls like textarea and select for
                richer user interaction. These elements allow for more complex data collection and provide a better user
                experience. In this blog, we will dive into these form controls and provide examples.

                The Textarea Element
                The textarea element is used when you need multiline text input from the user. This is particularly
                useful for comments, reviews, or any other type of input where the length is unpredictable.
                The rows and cols attributes define the visible dimensions of the textarea.
            </p>
            <div>
                <label for="comment">Enter your comment</label>
                <br>
                <textarea id="comment" name="comment" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>
            </div>
            <p>The Select Element
                The select element creates a dropdown menu for the user. It is useful when you have a predefined list of
                options for the user to choose from.</p>
                <div>
                    <select name="fruits">
                        <option value="apple">Apple</option>
                        <option value="banana">Banana</option>
                        <option value="cherry">Cherry</option>
                  </select>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <input type="submit" value="submit">

                </div>
               

        </form>
</body>
