    <!--An HTML Element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag, which together define the elementâ€™s structure 
    and functionality. Elements are the basic building blocks of a webpage and can represent different types of content, 
    such as text, links, images, or headings.

For example, the <p> element for paragraphs includes opening and closing tags with text content in between.-->
