    <p>Block-level elements are those that start on a new line and take up the entire width of their container by
        default. They essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after
        them to a new line.</p>
    <p>Hi i am a block element</p>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are part of the flow
        within other elements.

        Inline elements can contain other inline elements, but they generally should not contain block-level elements
